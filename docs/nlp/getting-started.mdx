## What is natural langage processing?

Machine language processing (NLP for short) is a sub-area of ​​computational linguistics. [49] NLP uses advances in the research field of artificial intelligence to understand and analyze human language [50]. NLP consists of several components, including a grammar that describes the syntax of a language, a dictionary that contains lexical word information, a semantic component that determines the meaning of a sentence and a parser. This parser annotates various pieces of information in a text. The parser uses heuristic methods such as the following:

-   Tokenization: Tokenization describes the segmentation of a text in tokens.

-   N-grams: N-grams are the sequence of n consecutive tokens or letters. N-grams of size n = 1 are also called unigrams, size n=2 bigrams and the largest n=3 trigrams. [11]

-   Sentence Splitter: In sentence splitting, the text is divided into sentences by analyzing the punctuation marks. [12]

-   “Part-of-Speech-Tagger” (POS-Tagger for short): A POS-Tagger describes a program that determines the part of speech for each token of a text by annotating a classification abbreviation. [12] A part of speech is a word classified according to morphological, syntactic or semantic criteria.
-   Lemmatization: In linguistics, lemmatization describes the formation of the basic form (also called “lemma”) of an inflected word. [52] For example, the lemma of the word "ein - ein" or the lemma of "hated - hate".

-   Named Entity Recognition (NER): NER is understood to be the identification of names of persons, organizations, geographical sizes as well as information on mass, currency and time. [12]
