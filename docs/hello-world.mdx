This is my second weekly update of 2021. Two weeks ago, I made a post about my goals for 2021 and as promised, I will give you an update on how I'm doing. Let's get right into it!

## Weekly Update

I would say that this week was the week of Rust. I dived into Rust much further, building some bigger projects and going into more advanced syntax. I started off the week by following an awesome tutorial which teaches you how to build a text editor in Rust. I extended this project by adding Python support for the text editor (which I named Lynx).

I also learnt more about lifetimes, borrowing, and unsafe code in Rust. A couple of days ago, I found a YouTube channel which is very helpful for people looking to learn intermediate Rust. I mostly followed the "Crust of Rust" streams, looking at Lifetimes, macros, unsafe code, and more. I also experimented with using async/await and Tokio in Rust by building multiple CLI applications which fetch 3rd party APIs. Towards the end of the week, I created my own Git CLI tool in Rust which can initialize a repository, add files, and commit files.

To finish off the week, I did some open source contributions for various different types of stuff. Overall, I think it was a successful week! For the upcoming week, I will focus on more Rust by building some more applications. Hopefully, I can also create a portfolio with Tailwind, and do some more open source contributions.

I also started my own newsletter, if you would like to get some more content from time to time, be sure to sign up!

Thanks for reading!
