## How to ruin your code (story) ? â˜ 

ðŸ‘‰ As i said earlier , when i was beginning with programming i was so foolish to not to follow coding principles like DRY (don't repeat yourself).

ðŸ‘‰ One definition was assigned to me , which was "write a program where have to do addition of 2 numbers 3 times"

ðŸ‘‰ The code i wrote earlier :

```javascript
var num1 = propmt('Enter no : ');
var num2 = propmt('Enter no : ');
var res = 0;
res = num1 + num2;
console.log(res);
var num3 = propmt('Enter no : ');
var num4 = propmt('Enter no : ');
res = num3 + num4;
console.log(res);
var num5 = propmt('Enter no : ');
var num6 = propmt('Enter no : ');
res = num5 + num6;
console.log(res);
```

ðŸ‘‰ This does make sense as a beginner , but when you think in terms of performance optimization , speed and quality of code - this doesn't make any sense.

ðŸ‘‰ After that i was introduced to concept known as Function

## Functions :

ðŸ‘‰ According to internet , Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.

ðŸ‘‰ To put it more simply and making it clear we'll go to our previous definition of 3 times of addition. so what we can say is that a perfect function is a mechanism to reduce that 3 times repeating code into simple block of code which can work for 3 or 30 or even 300 times depending on logic inside it. function simply means act of writing a reusable code.

## Syntax of function

ðŸ‘‰ Making a function can be defined in three steps

Function Definition : telling your compiler that there's a function in our program.

Function Body : Block of code to be executed when function gets called.

Function Call : Calling a function simply tells your compiler that execute the code written in function body in respective context.
