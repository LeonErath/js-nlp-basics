  "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say\n that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last\n people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,\n because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.",
  "Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\n drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did\n have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had\n nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she\n spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the\n neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their\n opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n",
  "As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw --\nand it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that\nmorning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the\nsame one; it had the same markings around its eyes.",
  "'Shoo!' said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn't move. It just gave him a\nstern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying\nto pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still\ndetermined not to mention anything to his wife.\n\nMrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all\nabout Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had\nlearned a new word ('Won't!'). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When\nDudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to\ncatch the last report on the evening news:\n",
